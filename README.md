# EDA_and_MODEL_CRYPTO

Crazy Crypto is a web application developed using Streamlit, Plotly and Tensorflow. 
It allows the users to view live data and informative graphs and also forecasts the prices of
top 15 crypto currencies using a LSTM model built using the data obtained from yfinance.

 ## Project Goal: 

 Built a forecasting model using LSTM to predict cryptocurrency prices and included interactive visualizations for analyzing recent trends.
 
## Data Collection: 

Automated data scraping from Yahoo Finance (yfinance) for training the model and creating visualizations.

## Model Training: 

Utilized LSTM neural networks with time-series data, training the model with 90% of historical closing prices and testing on the remaining 10%.

## Visualization: 

Developed dynamic graphs using Plotly to showcase historical, predicted, and future cryptocurrency price trends.

## Deployment: 

Integrated the project into a Streamlit app for user-friendly interaction and real-time data visualization.

## Cryptocurrency Options: 

Included support for 15 cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, DOGE, and SOL for trend analysis and price prediction.

## Future Price Forecast: 

Predicted cryptocurrency prices for 30 days into the future using the trained LSTM model, visualized through interactive charts.

## Live Updates: 

Incorporated a feature to fetch and display live cryptocurrency data at one-minute intervals.
